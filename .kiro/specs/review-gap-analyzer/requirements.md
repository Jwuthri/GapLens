# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Review Gap Analyzer is a web application that helps developers, startups, and product managers identify unmet user needs by analyzing negative app reviews from Google Play Store and iOS App Store. The system automatically processes reviews using NLP to detect recurring complaint themes, ranks them by frequency and recency, and presents actionable insights through a clean dashboard interface. This eliminates manual review analysis and transforms user frustration into product opportunity discovery.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to input an app ID from Google Play or App Store, so that I can analyze negative reviews and identify common user complaints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a valid Google Play app ID THEN the system SHALL fetch and store all available reviews for that app
2. WHEN a user enters a valid App Store app ID THEN the system SHALL fetch and store all available reviews for that app
3. WHEN a user enters a Google Play Store URL THEN the system SHALL extract the app ID and fetch reviews
4. WHEN a user enters an App Store URL THEN the system SHALL extract the app ID and fetch reviews
5. WHEN an invalid app ID or URL is entered THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message indicating the app was not found
6. WHEN the system fetches reviews THEN it SHALL respect rate limits and handle pagination automatically
7. IF the app has more than 1000 reviews THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recent reviews first

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want the system to automatically process and categorize negative reviews, so that I can quickly understand the main pain points without reading hundreds of individual reviews.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviews are processed THEN the system SHALL filter for reviews with 1-2 star ratings only
2. WHEN processing reviews THEN the system SHALL clean text by removing stopwords, emojis, and duplicate content
3. WHEN clustering reviews THEN the system SHALL use NLP techniques to group similar complaints together
4. WHEN clusters are created THEN the system SHALL generate descriptive names for each complaint category
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL store clustered results with sample review quotes for each category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a startup founder, I want to see complaint clusters ranked by frequency and recency, so that I can prioritize which user problems to address first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL rank complaint clusters by percentage of total negative reviews
2. WHEN calculating rankings THEN the system SHALL weight recent reviews (last 3 months) more heavily than older reviews
3. WHEN showing cluster details THEN the system SHALL display the percentage of reviews affected by each complaint
4. WHEN presenting clusters THEN the system SHALL include 2-3 representative quote examples for each category
5. IF no negative reviews exist THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating insufficient data for analysis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view insights through a clean dashboard interface, so that I can quickly understand the analysis results and identify key opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display a summary showing total reviews and percentage of negative reviews
2. WHEN showing complaint clusters THEN the system SHALL present them in a clear list or chart format
3. WHEN displaying time trends THEN the system SHALL show a line chart of complaint frequency by month
4. WHEN a user clicks on a cluster THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed information and sample quotes
5. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators during processing

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to export analysis results to CSV or JSON format, so that I can share insights with my team and integrate with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a CSV file containing cluster names, percentages, and sample quotes
2. WHEN JSON export is selected THEN the system SHALL provide structured data including all cluster details and metadata
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include timestamp and app information in the export
4. WHEN download is initiated THEN the system SHALL provide the file within 10 seconds
5. IF export fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest trying again

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle data storage and processing efficiently, so that multiple users can analyze different apps simultaneously without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing reviews THEN the system SHALL save app ID, review ID, rating, text, date, and locale for each review
2. WHEN processing multiple requests THEN the system SHALL handle background jobs without blocking the user interface
3. WHEN the same app is analyzed multiple times THEN the system SHALL update existing data rather than duplicate storage
4. WHEN database operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and handle connection failures gracefully
5. IF processing takes longer than 2 minutes THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates to the user

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want to input my website URL to collect and analyze feedback from various review platforms and social media, so that I can understand customer sentiment across all online channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a website URL THEN the system SHALL identify the associated business and search for reviews across multiple platforms
2. WHEN searching for website reviews THEN the system SHALL check Google Reviews, Yelp, Facebook, Twitter, and other relevant review platforms
3. WHEN collecting website feedback THEN the system SHALL aggregate reviews and social media mentions related to the business
4. WHEN processing website feedback THEN the system SHALL normalize data from different sources into a consistent format
5. WHEN website analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL present unified insights combining feedback from all discovered sources
6. IF no reviews are found for a website THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating insufficient data and suggest alternative search terms

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be built with FastAPI backend and Next.js frontend, so that I have a modern, performant, and maintainable technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the backend THEN the system SHALL use FastAPI framework for API development
2. WHEN implementing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use Next.js framework for the web application
3. WHEN API endpoints are created THEN they SHALL follow RESTful conventions and include proper documentation
4. WHEN the frontend communicates with backend THEN it SHALL use proper HTTP methods and handle responses appropriately
5. WHEN deploying the application THEN both frontend and backend SHALL be deployable as separate services
