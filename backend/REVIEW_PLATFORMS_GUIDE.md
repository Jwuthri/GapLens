## Anti-Bot Protection

All new platforms use **Scrapling** for anti-bot protection, which provides:

- Automatic browser fingerprint rotation
- Proxy support
- CAPTCHA handling
- Rate limiting protection
- User-agent rotation
- Cookie management

### Installation

```bash
pip install scrapling==0.2.1
```

### Fallback Mechanism

If Scrapling is not available or fails, the system automatically falls back to regular HTTP requests with basic anti-detection measures.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from app.services.website_review_aggregator import WebsiteReviewAggregator

async def get_reviews():
    async with WebsiteReviewAggregator() as aggregator:
        # Get reviews for a website
        reviews = await aggregator.aggregate_website_reviews("https://example.com")
        
        # Reviews are automatically collected from all supported platforms
        for review in reviews:
            print(f"Platform: {review.source_platform}")
            print(f"Rating: {review.rating}")
            print(f"Text: {review.text}")
            print(f"Author: {review.author}")
            print("---")
```

### Platform-Specific Scraping

```python
async def get_g2_reviews():
    async with WebsiteReviewAggregator() as aggregator:
        # Get reviews from G2 specifically
        g2_reviews = await aggregator.scrape_g2_reviews("Slack")
        
        for review in g2_reviews:
            print(f"G2 Review: {review.text}")
```

### API Configuration

For platforms that support official APIs, configure API keys:

```python
aggregator.configure_apis(
    google_places_api_key="your_google_api_key",
    yelp_api_key="your_yelp_api_key",
    facebook_access_token="your_facebook_token",
    twitter_bearer_token="your_twitter_token"
)
```

## Platform-Specific Notes

### Software Platforms (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius)
- Focus on B2B software and SaaS products
- Usually require exact product names for best results
- Reviews often include detailed feature feedback
- Ratings typically on 1-5 scale

### Travel Platforms (TripAdvisor, Booking.com, etc.)
- Best for hotels, restaurants, and travel services
- Location-based matching improves accuracy
- Reviews often include photos and detailed experiences
- Rating scales may vary (some use 1-10, others 1-5)

### Restaurant Platforms (Zomato, OpenTable)
- Optimized for food service businesses
- Location and cuisine type help with matching
- Reviews focus on food quality, service, and ambiance
- May include delivery/takeout specific feedback

### Social Platforms (Facebook, Twitter)
- Capture mentions and sentiment rather than formal reviews
- Real-time feedback and customer service interactions
- May not have traditional rating systems
- Useful for brand monitoring and reputation management

## Rate Limiting and Best Practices

### Recommended Limits
- **Concurrent requests**: Max 3 per platform
- **Request delay**: 1-2 seconds between requests
- **Reviews per platform**: Limit to 30 per business
- **Daily limits**: Respect platform terms of service

### Error Handling
The system includes comprehensive error handling:
- Network timeouts (10 seconds default)
- HTTP error responses
- Parsing failures
- Rate limiting responses
- CAPTCHA challenges

### Data Quality
Reviews are automatically filtered for:
- Minimum text length (10 characters)
- Maximum text length (5000 characters)
- Valid rating ranges (1-5 scale)
- Duplicate detection by content similarity

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# API Keys (optional, enables official API access)
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_key_here
YELP_API_KEY=your_key_here
FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Scrapling Configuration (optional)
SCRAPLING_PROXY_URL=http://proxy:port
SCRAPLING_USER_AGENT=custom_user_agent
```

### Custom Headers
```python
# Custom headers for specific platforms
custom_headers = {
    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate, br',
    'Cache-Control': 'no-cache'
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify platform integration:

```bash
python backend/test_new_platforms.py
```

This will test each platform individually and show:
- Number of reviews found
- Sample review content
- Any errors encountered
- Platform-specific statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No reviews found**
   - Check business name spelling
   - Try variations of the business name
   - Verify the business exists on the platform

2. **Scrapling errors**
   - Ensure Scrapling is properly installed
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify proxy settings if using proxies

3. **Rate limiting**
   - Reduce concurrent requests
   - Add delays between requests
   - Use API keys where available

4. **Parsing errors**
   - Platform HTML structure may have changed
   - Check for platform updates
   - Review CSS selectors in scraping methods

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed scraping information:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Legal Considerations

- Always respect robots.txt files
- Follow platform terms of service
- Use official APIs when available
- Implement appropriate rate limiting
- Consider data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Cache results to minimize requests

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Machine learning for better business matching
- Sentiment analysis integration
- Real-time review monitoring
- Advanced duplicate detection
- Multi-language support
- Review authenticity scoring
